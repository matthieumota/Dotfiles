# Matthieu's Dotfiles

This project serves me to install, configure and maintain my development workflow on macOS / Ubuntu / Arch. Like that, I can easily reset a Mac or Linux machine and start fresh without installing manually !

I'm back to Arch Linux !

## A fresh macOS / Ubuntu / Arch

Before begin to re-install your machine, please check this steps :

- Did you commit and push on all your repositories ?
- Did you save all your documents not present in Cloud.

You can now install a clean macOS or Ubuntu.

## Usage

You can now clone this repository :

```bash
git clone git@github.com:matthieumota/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
# On your Mac
./setup-mac.sh
# On your Ubuntu
./setup-ubuntu.sh
# On your Arch
./setup-arch.sh
```
